# Leeds Mobile Code of Conduct

We are committed to reviewing our policy and good practice annually. 
**This document was last review on:**  11 August 2023

**1. OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY** 

1.1. At Leeds Mobile, we want all of our events to offer a positive and safe environment for all attendees and participants. We believe that diverse representation at events ultimately creates a stronger community. 

1.2. We follow a Code of Conduct for all our events in order to create the best experience possible for all attendees. Before you participate in an Leeds Mobile event, you’re required to read the Code of Conduct below. 

**2. CODE OF CONDUCT** 

2.1. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, vendors, partners and volunteers at events organised and run by Leeds Mobile are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct. The Leeds Mobile event organisers will enforce this Code throughout an event. 

2.2. Our aim in hosting and running events is to build community and create learning opportunities for people. To that end, Leeds Mobile’s goal is to create an environment where everyone feels welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in conversation. We invite all those who participate in one of our events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. 

2.3. Every Leeds Mobile event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment in any form. 

**3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR** 

3.1. The underpinning principle for Leeds Mobile’s Code of Conduct is simple: **be excellent to each other.** 

3.2. That means: 
* 3.2.1. Participate in an authentic, supportive and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the community. 
* 3.2.2. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. 
* 3.2.3. Attempt collaboration before conflict. 
* 3.2.4. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. 
* 3.2.5. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. 

**4. WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE A CONCERN** 

4.1. If you’re being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an Leeds Mobile organiser in the first instance - either immediately, in person, to a member of our event team or subsequently on the email.

4.2. If necessary, Leeds Mobile staff will help participants contact venue security (if at an external venue) or emergency services. If, however, you feel yours or another attendee’s physical safety is in jeopardy, please call 999 directly. 

4.3. Our team are here to listen to your concerns or questions, and you don’t have to make a formal report unless you want to. 

4.4. If you do wish to report an incident, we will take details of the harassment and work with you to respond to the issue in a way that assists you in feeling safe. All reports are confidential. 

4.5. When reporting an incident in writing to our events team using the contact details provided here, please try to provide as much information as possible but do not interview people about the incident. 

4.6. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the Leeds Mobile team have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is for the other attendees. 

**5. WHEN AND WHERE THIS CODE OF CONDUCT APPLIES** 

5.1. We expect everyone at Leeds Mobile events to adhere to our principle of being kind and considerate at all times. 

5.2. In the case of this Code of Conduct, we expect participants to follow these rules at all venues where events are hosted, and related social events (for example, post-event pub drinks, networking discussions, and workshops). 

5.3. Any sponsors or third parties are also subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, third parties should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. 

**6. EXCEPTIONS** 

6.1. Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar is acceptable if it meets all of the following criteria: 
* 6.2. The organisers have specifically granted permission in writing. 
* 6.3. It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists. 
* 6.4. It is presented in a respectful manner. 
* 6.5. Attendees are warned in advance and respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand. 
* 6.6. This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples. 

**7. CONTACT**
