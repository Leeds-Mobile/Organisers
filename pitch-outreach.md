Hi there.

I wanted to get in touch about a new meet-up called Leeds Mobile. The aim for this meetup is to build a community for sharing knowledge and experiences of building, designing, testing and delivering mobile applications. Everyone is welcome, regardless of their background, and importantly it is not just developers!

The plan is to run an event once a month, and to host it in person. Weâ€™ll aim to have one talk per event, which will be proceeded by us getting some food to feed attendees, and then followed by an optional visit to a nearby pub. 

The aim is to host the event at different business in and around Leeds, and to have a broad range of topics about mobile apps to attract a diverse audience.

Is this something you would be interested in attending? If so click the button on Meetup to let us know.
