# Leeds Mobile

Leeds Mobile is community for sharing knowledge and experiences of building, designing, testing and delivering mobile applications. Everyone is welcome, regardless of your background, and importantly this community is not just for developers!

We run one event per month, and host it in person. Weâ€™ll aim to have one talk per event, which will be proceeded by us getting some food to feed attendees, and then followed by an optional visit to a nearby pub.
